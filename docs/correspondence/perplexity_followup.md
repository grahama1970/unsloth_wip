Here are clear, actionable answers to your additional clarifying questions, based on our conversation and the latest context:

---

## 1. Qwen3-Reranker-4B Dataset Choice

**Preferred choice:**  
Use **MS MARCO passage ranking** or **BEIR benchmark datasets** for initial pipeline testing with Qwen3-Reranker-4B.  
- **MS MARCO** is the de facto standard for passage ranking in industry and research, and is directly supported by Hugging Face and the BEIR benchmark[1][8][3].
- **BEIR** offers a broader suite of retrieval tasks and is ideal for evaluating generalization[5][6].
- **Custom ArangoDB pairs** can be valuable for domain-specific tasks, but should be introduced after validating the pipeline on standard benchmarks.
- **Alpaca-cleaned** is not suitable for ranking-specific evaluation; switch to ranking data from the start.

## 2. RunPod API Key

the RUNPOD_API_KEY is in the .env file at
/home/graham/workspace/experiments/unsloth_wip/.env

---

## 3. Student-Teacher Enhancement for Ranking

- **Generate ranking explanations:** The teacher should provide explanations for why one passage ranks higher than another.
- **Focus on pairwise comparisons:** This is the core of reranking tasks.
- **Current Q&A format** is not optimal; adapt the enhancement to generate pairwise ranking rationale.

---

## 4. Entropy Weighting Function

- **Make the weighting function configurable:** Allow users to choose between linear, exponential, and sigmoid functions.
- **Add a scaling factor parameter:** This increases flexibility and allows for tuning the impact of entropy.
- **Start with the simple linear function as the default** for initial implementation and documentation.

---

## 5. Claude Command File Format

- **Follow the existing pattern** (Python files with markdown documentation) for consistency and maintainability.
- **Do not introduce a new format** unless there is a compelling reason to change.

---

## 6. TensorBoard Port Configuration

- **Make the TensorBoard port configurable** (e.g., via environment variable or command-line argument).
- **Default to port 6006** for compatibility, but allow users to override it in case of conflicts.

---

## 7. HuggingFace Model Naming Convention

- **Recommend a structured naming pattern** for clarity and traceability, such as:
  - `{username}/{base_model_name}-entropy-enhanced`
  - `{username}/{base_model_name}-unsloth-{timestamp}`
- **Allow users to specify custom names** as an override, but provide a default pattern for consistency.

If you prefer, I can document these choices as defaults in your codebase and provide clear guidance for users.
